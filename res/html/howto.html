<H2>How to use the program</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>


According to Wikipedia, 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram"><I>Tangram</I></A>
is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven pieces
which fit together to form a shape of some sort.
This program implements <I>Tangram</I> and other
dissection puzzles.
<P>
This document takes some liberty with the terminology.
Each piece of <I>Tangram</I> is called a <I>tan</I>
and a configuration of pieces is called a <I>tangram</I>
(lower case).
In this document, the words "tan" and "tangram" denote a piece
and a configuration of a dissecting puzzle of the
program whether or not the puzzle is <I>Tangram</I>.


<H3>The GUI</H3>

The graphical interface contains 3 main areas: 
the <em>menu</em> (top of the interface, Fig. 1), 
the <em>Control</em> (left, Fig. 2) and 
the <em>Playboard</em> (right, Fig. 3).

<P>

The <em>Control</em> contains 4 buttons and a small black area with
a white shape centered inside.  
The black area is the <em>goal view</em> and
the white shape inside it is a tangram referred to
as the <em>current goal</em>.
The buttons select the current goal and some options about it.

<P>

The colored polygons in the <em>Playboard</em> are the tans.
The tans can be dragged, rotated and flipped with the mouse.
The purpose of a game is to arrange the
tans in a shape similar to the tangram shown
by the <em>current goal</em>.

<H3>Tangrams</H3>

<H4>Changing the tangram</H4>

There is a small database of tangrams for any puzzle.
Two buttons, <em>Prev Goal</em> and <em>Next Goal</em>,
move the <em>current goal</em> through the database.

<H4>Solving the current goal</H4>

The <em>Easy</em> button of the <em>Control</em>
produces a representation of the <em>current goal</em>, at natural size,
on the <em>Playboard</em>.
In contrast to the tans on the <em>Playboard</em>,
this representation of the tangram cannot be moved.
<P>

The button labeled <em>Solve</em> shows the solution
of the game in the <em>current goal</em>.

<H4>Managing the tangram database</H4>

Tangrams can be added to and deleted from the database.
To delete the <em>current goal</em> choose the
<em>delete</em> item in the <em>Goals</em> menu entry.
The "initial" tangram of a set cannot be deleted.
<P>
To add a new tangram, place the tans
in the desired configuration and choose the
<em>add</em> item in the <em>Goals</em> menu entry.
The newly added tangram is placed after the current goal
and it becomes the new current goal.

<P>

Every configuration of tans can be
made into a tangram.  But configurations with 
overlapping tans should be avoided.
The <I>Easy</I> option does not handle these configurations
correctly.

<P>

The database of tangrams may be permanently saved to disk.
This feature is affected by how the program is started and by
the permission to write on the local disk.
To save the database choose the <em>save</em>
item in the <em>Goals</em> menu entry.
The choice may be disabled or fail depending on the above conditions.

<H3>Manipulating the tans</H3>

The tans can partially or totally overlap.
Any mouse click on a tan brings it to the top.

<P>

The mouse enables the following actions.
See the "Using keyboard keys" section below for some alternatives
to mouse actions.

  </TR>
</TABLE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

A rotation is always by 45 degrees.

<P>

The corners of the tans attract each other when they are
in proximity.  This feature eases the placement of tans.
This feature may preclude some small movements that would put
two corners a few pixels apart.

<H3>Menu</H3>

The <em>menu</em> affects global actions and setting of the program.

<P>

Several sets of tans may be available in the program.
A set of tans can be selected with the
<em>Open</em> item in the <em>File</em> menu entry.

<P>

The program default settings, except for the configuration
of the tans, can be restored with the
<em>Default</em> item in the <em>File</em> menu entry.

<P>

The <em>Easy</em> option is local to the current tangram.
The <em>menu</em> allows setting this option permanently
with the <em>Always easy</em> item in the <em>Options</em> menu entry.

<P>

An audible sound can be produced when the corners of
two tans touch, i.e., the tans
fall in place.  By default, the sound is disabled.
It can be enabled by toggling
the <em>Quiet</em> item in the <em>Options</em> menu entry.

<P> 

The <em>Goals</em> menu entry supports the manipulations of
tangrams as discussed earlier.

<P> 

The <em>Help</em> menu entry provides information about the
program.

<H3>Using keyboard keys</H3>

Some frequent menu and mouse actions can be obtained
with keyboard keys.  Menu entries and button labels
display the key for obtaining the corresponding action.

<P>

In particular, the tans can be moved using
only the left button.  When the left button is down
on a <em>Tan</em>, the keys enable the following actions.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

    <TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="3">

    <TH>Key</TH>

  <TR>
    <TD>F</TD>
    <TD>flip</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

The case, i.e., upper vs. lower, of a key is irrelevant.

<H3>New Puzzles</H3>

A <em>Puzzle</em> is a set of tans and its database of tangrams.
It is possible to add new puzzles without changing and recompiling the program.
Adding a puzzle entails creating a text file with extensions
<TT><B>xml</B></TT> and placing it in the directory <TT><B>res/xml</B></TT>.
This directory contains several puzzle files.
The definition of a puzzle file is not yet documented,
but the content and format, which can be inspected with a text editor,
are relatively self-explanatory.

<H3>TODO, bugs</H3>

<H4>Diplaying tangrams</H4>

It takes a considerably long time to display some tangrams
in the <em>goal view</em>.  
Probably the time goes into scaling the image 4:1.  
Maybe there is a better way to achieve the effect.

<H4>Adding tangrams</H4>

Tangrams with overlapping tans should be detected and rejected,
since the easy silouette is incorrectly computed for these tangrams.


<H3>Acknowledgment</H3>

<A HREF="http://www.mathadomicile.fr">Philippe Moutou</A>
contributed the machine executable definition,
in the form of an XML document, of many puzzles and suggested several
improvements to an earlier version of this program.
Harold Fuchs (London, England) helped with the terminology.
