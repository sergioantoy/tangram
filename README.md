# Tangram

Implementation of [tangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram) and other dissection puzzles consisting of flat polygons, called tans, which are put together to form shapes. 

## Motivation

An opportunity to code in Java and to apply design patterns (Singleton, Factories, Interpreter and, of course, MVC.)

The puzzle is entertaining.

## Getting Started

Linux scripts for compiling and executing the program are in the `cmd` folder.
The program is already compiled in forms suitable for some environments:

+ `appletviewer /`*path*`/tangram.html`
+ `java -jar /`*path*`/tangram.jar`
+ `javaws http://`*path*`/tangram.jnlp` 

## Usage

Instructions are in the file `tangram.html` and there is a "How to" in the Help menu. The GUI is intuitive, just click and/or drag a colored tan.
