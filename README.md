# Tangram

Implementation of [tangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram) and other dissection puzzles consisting of flat polygons, called tans, which are put together to form shapes. 

## Motivation

An opportunity to code in Java and to apply design patterns (Singleton, Factories, Interpreter and, of course, MVC.)

The puzzle is entertaining.

## Getting Started

Linux scripts for compiling and executing the program are in the `cmd` folder. The program comes already compiled in a "jar".  It can be downloaded and executed with `java -jar /`*path*`/tangram.jar` where *path* is the relative path of the jar.

## Usage

Instructions are in the file `tangram.html` and there is a "How to" in the Help menu. The GUI is intuitive, just click and/or drag a colored tan.
